# Smart Mara
This is a small project to utilize my MaraX serial interface for some IoT capability using a ESP8266 and a SSD1306 OLED display.

I used [SaibotFlow's beatiful marax-monitor project](https://github.com/SaibotFlow/marax-monitor/tree/main) and added my personal stuff such as MQTT support for my OpenHAB home automation setup. 

Future releases will incorporate additional functions, I don't have a specific roadmap currently though.

For instruction how to use and setup the hardware, please refer to the following wonderful projects, I plan to add them in this repo as well:

* [SaibotFlow's beatiful marax-monitor project](https://github.com/SaibotFlow/marax-monitor/tree/main)
* [calin's excellent post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/hft5zv/data_visualisation_lelit_marax_mod/)
* [alexrus' great marax_timer project](https://github.com/alexrus/marax_timer)
